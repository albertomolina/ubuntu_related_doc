# Ubuntu related documentation

The aim to create this repository is to include some relevant issues
found when working with Ubuntu coming from Debian and to write down
some notes about it. This includes mainly interaction with Canonical
supported applications snapd, lxd, juju, maas, etc. Those software
applications can be used in Debian and other linux distros, but it's
not so common like in Ubuntu and they're presented here as
"Canonical's ecosystem".

## Canonical's ecosystem

1. [snap](snap/snap.md)
1. [lxd](https://linuxcontainers.org/)
1. [juju](https://juju.is/)
